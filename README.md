# Contact-scraper
Built a contact scraper using selenium to collect data on new up-and-coming start-up companies.

My bot recreates a chrome window and gets all the data of the companies listed on "ycombinator.com".

# What is scraped?
It opens a new window for each company listed on the website and then gets the company website, Company LinkedIn page, Founder's LinkedIn page and Co-Founder's LinkedIn page as well.

# How it stores data?
It stores the data in a txt file named "example.txt" in the following format:

Company name:
  Company website
  Company LinkedIn
  Company Founder LinkeIn page
  company Co-founder LinkedIn page
